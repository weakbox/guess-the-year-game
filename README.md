## Comments

- The Windows XP aesthetic was carefully recreated using pure CSS. It took quite a bit of attention to detail and styling to get it right (I was pixel-peeping pretty hard). I found that while I was able to get the look pretty spot on, the high resolution of today's screens make it look a little strange (uncanny, if you will). Nevertheless, you can peer into a strange future where XP remains used on modern devices!

- The question bank uses a local JSON file, functioning as a local API for storing and retrieving questions. This design makes it straightforward to integrate with an external API for expanded functionality. I wanted to implement it this way as an easy way to demonstrate flexibility and scalability.

- The site was designed using mobile-first development principles, ensuring a seamless user experience on small screens. The desktop experience could be improved in future revisions, but it is entirely functional.
